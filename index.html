			  Hello, it's me, I was wondering
			  If after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything
			  They say that time's supposed to heal, yeah
			  But I ain't done much healing
			  Hello, can you hear me?
			  I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
			  When we were younger and free
			  I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
			  There's such a difference between us
			  And a million miles
